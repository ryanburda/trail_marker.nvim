*trail_marker.txt*

Trail Marker does not put you on a trail by default. Run the following to create a new trail:
-- TODO: create a better list of available commands.
```
:TrailMarker new_trail demo
```

Place a marker on the trail by running:
```
:TrailMarker place_marker
```

Remove a marker with:
```
:TrailMarker remove_marker
```

Navigate between markers using:
```
:TrailMarker prev_marker
:TrailMarker next_marker
```

If multiple trails exist you can switch between them using:
```
:TrailMarker change_trail <trail_name>
```

Leave the current trail:
```
:TrailMarker leave_trail
```

## Keymaps
Trail Marker doesn't assign any default keymaps. Any of the lua or user commands can be added as you see fit.

Example:
```lua
vim.keymap.set(
  'n',
  '<leader>ta',
  require("trail_marker").place_marker,  -- lua commands
  { desc = "Trail Marker: Add marker to current trail" }
)

vim.keymap.set(
  'n',
  '<leader>tn',
  ':TrailMarker new_trail ',  -- User command when more input like a trail name is needed.
  { desc = "Trail Marker: New trail" }
)
```

## Roadmap
- Trail sharing
- Export as Github links
- Add notes to markers
